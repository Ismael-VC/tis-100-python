# tis-100-python

After playing a lot of [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) I decided to implement the instruction set in python.

Here it is.

My aim is to follow the specification as closely as possible, but I have added the pseudo-register 'OUT' to be used for printing to the console.
